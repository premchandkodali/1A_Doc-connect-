1. Introduction to the Foundation Level Extensions,H1
This overview document is intended for anyone with an interest in the ISTQB Foundation Level,Body
Extensions who wants a high-level introduction to the leading principles and an overview of the individual,Body
extension syllabi.,Body
"From time to time, ISTQB will update this document to reflect any additional extensions that shall be",Body
"introduced for the Foundation Level, or to reflect major changes in existing ones. Publications of the",Body
updated document will be available on the ISTQB website.,Body
The ISTQB Foundation and Advanced Level syllabi have been defined and have been on the market for,Body
some time. New topics emerge due to technology and methodology changes in the market which often,Body
"are brought into the ISTQB program as new Expert Level syllabi. However, not all topics are suited for the",Body
"Expert Level. For this reason, the extension syllabi are established at the Foundation Level to expand the",Body
ISTQB program to incorporate new or updated knowledge. New extensions shall be discussed and,Body
"introduced by the ISTQB periodically. Extensions may be established at the Advanced Level as well, but",Body
that is beyond the scope of this document.,Body
The following Foundation Level Extension syllabus has been released:,Body
,Body
Agile Tester,Body
"In this document, each Foundation Level Extension syllabus is summarized and the associated Business",Body
Outcomes are stated. The Business Outcomes communicate what can be expected from a person who,Body
"achieves a Foundation Level Extension Certification in a particular subject area (e.g., Agile Tester), and",Body
will outline the benefits for companies that are considering the development of specific testing skills at this,Body
level.,Body

Background,H2
"First, some background on the ODL. For the last two years the Ontario Library Association",Body
"has acted as a catalyst, bringing together the stakeholders needed to create the Ontario",Body
"Digital Library (ODL). These stakeholders include Ontario’s 5000+ public libraries, university,",Body
"college, and school libraries, as well as Ontario government ministries.",Body
Libraries that serve very different clientele recognize that by working together they can create,Body
"seamless access to quality electronic library services. Through the ODL, students will be",Body
"able to explore a topic at school, use the same child-safe resources after school (either at",Body
"home or at a public library), enter college or university with a knowledge of how to use",Body
"electronic resources that are still available and then, after graduation, continue to use these",Body
skills and resources at work or at home.,Body
We are moving into a period of convergence. With convergence we no longer have to license,Body
commercial products as individual libraries or institutions. We can work together to spend our,Body
money wisely. The provincial government has made this possible by working hard to provide,Body
"all Ontarians with a stable, high-speed communications infrastructure. While there is still a",Body
"great deal of work needed to improve this infrastructure, libraries are beginning to plan how",Body
best to exploit communications technology. We can reduce barriers to access and create the,Body
content infrastructure needed to support a knowledge society.,Body
"The concept of an ODL is a key element in The Roadmap to Prosperity , a strategic plan to",Body
envision and attain Ontario’s economic goal prepared by the Ontario Jobs and Investment,Body
Board. The OJIB strategic plan recommends an electronic library to “connect students to new,Body
"workplaces, new sources of information and applied learning opportunities”. The ODL will do",Body
"that and much more. The ODL will connect students to electronic information, and will also",Body
leverage this investment to help connect all citizens to the electronic information they need as,Body
"they make decisions, solve problems and enhance their quality of life.",Body
Libraries have long been a key delivery point for public services. The ODL will allow that,Body
"delivery point to move closer to citizens, into the smallest of libraries and even into living",Body
rooms.,Body
"Libraries have a long tradition of using a practical, consultative approach to solving problems,",Body
and of learning from others. The ODL is a very practical solution to various problems.,Body
Jurisdiction-wide digital libraries are very practical and very real. The ODL we propose is,Body
leading edge for Ontario but several jurisdictions have forged the path with collaborative,Body
"digital libraries. We can learn from their experiences. For example, The Alberta Library (TAL)",Body
RFP: To Develop the Ontario Digital Library Business Plan,Body
March 2003,Body
3333,Body
was incorporated in 1997 as a province-wide library consortium. TAL works collaboratively,Body
with its members to promote universal access to materials and resources in more than 250,Body
"public, post-secondary, special, government and regional libraries. Unlike ODL, TAL does",Body
"not include elementary or secondary schools. However, the timeline and funding we are",Body
proposing for ODL is comparable to TAL‘s experience. TAL’s business planning took several,Body
years. TAL’s implementation plan was supported by 8 million dollars in provincially shared,Body
"funding, spread over three years, later revised to 15 million dollars over 4 years. Not only is",Body
"Alberta’s population 30% of Ontario’s, TAL does not include elementary or secondary",Body
schools as partners; it has 250 member libraries. ODL envisions universal access for all,Body
"10,000,000 Ontarians, with more than 5000 Ontario libraries as partners. Although ODL can",Body
"learn from TAL’s practices, the scope of planning and implementing ODL is much larger than",Body
TAL.,Body
The ODL will be a partnership-based organization providing seamless electronic information,Body
services and resources to the citizens of Ontario. It will use local libraries as the entry point for,Body
common resources The ODL will recognize the unique responsibilities and needs of public,Body
"libraries, school libraries, college and university libraries and special libraries. The ODL",Body
"envisions a digital network of information resources, allowing members to collaborate when",Body
there is mutual benefit and to support the common mandates of local libraries.,Body
The principles which will define and guide the ODL are:,Body
Equitable access for all Ontarians:,H3
"We will bring consistent, high-quality electronic resources and services to 10 million",Body
Ontario citizens,Body
We will eliminate barriers to the access to information and create more consistent,Body
services for library clients.,Body
Shared decision-making and accountability:,H3
We will facilitate consensus among members regarding ODL’s portfolio of electronic,Body
licenses and services,Body
We will balance the interests and realities of small and large as well as rich and poor,Body
communities and institutions.,Body
Shared governance structure:,H3
We will share decision-making in order to enable the people we serve.,Body
We will work based on an underlying assumption of trust and synergy.,Body
Shared funding:,H3
"We will leverage provincial, institutional, and local dollars to realize economies of scale",Body
and put Ontario dollars to work for everyone .,Body
We will be willing to pool talents and dollars in order to provide common services that are,Body
truly greater than those that can be maintained by individual institutions.,Body
RFP: To Develop the Ontario Digital Library Business Plan,Body
March 2003,Body
4444,Body
Local points of entry:,H3
"We will provide the licenses, infrastructure, services and support that enable local",Body
"libraries to provide exceptional services to their clientele. ODL will focus on support,",Body
"providing the underpinning, not overshadowing.",Body
Services envisioned for the ODL’s include:,Body
Access:,H3
"to the “deep” web (i.e. Commercial, purchased electronic services)",Body
to credible web sites and electronic resources,Body
to digital government information,Body
to local digital collections,Body
Guidance and Advice:,H3
to support e-learning,Body
"to support citizens, in real-time, as they try to use electronic resources",Body
to assist citizens as they use web-links,Body
Training:,H3
for library workers,Body
for the general public,Body
Provincial Purchasing & Licensing:,H3
of electronic content on a consortia basis for all member libraries,Body
Technological Support:,H3
of common standards for the preservation and archiving local digital content,Body
of a common interface to ODL resources and services that can be imbedded in local,Body
library web sites,Body
What could the ODL really mean?,H3
For each Ontario citizen it could mean:,H4
One local point of entry to access seamless electronic library services and,Body
"resources for their personal, educational and professional needs;",Body
"Access to credible, high-quality, user-friendly electronic services through their",Body
"community, school, or academic library;",Body
Confidence that the electronic services and sources they – and their children,Body

Appendix A:  ODL Envisioned Phases & Funding,Body
Phase I:  Business Planning,Body
Timeline: March 2003 – September 2003,Body
"Funding Requested: ~$100,000 jointly funded by stakeholder groups and the provincial government.",Body
Result: The ODL business plan,Body
"The first phase will be to build the ODL business plan. This plan will clearly define the ODL’s services,",Body
"funding and governance structures, as well as implementation plans for 2003-2005. It will also secure",Body
the full commitment of all stakeholders and scope the operational plan for ODL for 2006 and beyond.,Body
"Given the number and diversity of stakeholders involved, the business planning process must be a fully",Body
consultative approach. To ensure that the planning results in a workable plan with the full commitment,Body
"of all stakeholders it must have competent, dedicated staffing and monies for the travel and",Body
communication components so critical in a consultative process.,Body
Phase II: Implementing and Transitioning,H3
Timeline: April 2004 – December 2006,Body
Funding Requested: Funding from other states and provinces suggest that the ODL could receive,Body
"funding of up to $50 Million (over 3 years). Funding to be provided partnership of government, library",Body
stakeholders and other interested parties.,Body
Result: The ODL is implemented and validated,Body
The second phase will be to implement the ODL based on the business plan. This phase recognizes,Body
that for ODL to be optimally successful libraries must transition to a new way of doing business and,Body
providing services. The transition must occur while libraries continue to provide existing services and,Body
"respond to current challenges. This implementation phase will funded by a partnership of government,",Body
library stakeholders and other interested parties as a means to quickly jumpstart the ODL.,Body
The seed money requested will allow libraries to realign their budgets and services as the infrastructure,Body
"and content of the ODL is created and secured. Some of the funding will be new money, although there",Body
is every indication that existing budgets and methods of operating may be modified as a result of,Body
"recommendations . During this phase the polices, procedures, governance structures and accountability",Body
"mechanisms of the ODL will be put in place. Pilot projects will be initiated, evaluated and expanded.",Body
"Information resources will be identified, contracts for these resources will be negotiated and resources",Body
will be made deployed through the ODL. Regular evaluation during this phase will ensure the ODL is,Body
achieving its objectives and is accountable to its key communities.,Body
Phase III: Operating and Growing the ODL,H3
Timeline: January 2007 -,Body
Funding: $50 Million annually ($35 Million requested from government),Body
Result: The ODL is fully operational and sustainable,Body
In the third phase the ODL moves into the operational stage. Ontarians will experience the full benefits,Body
of the initiative and libraries will consolidate support around the ODL to grow resources and extend,Body

capabilities. The challenge is to secure resources sufficient to both sustain the original investments and,Body
to enhance the ODL.,Body
The ongoing funding of the ODL will be based on a partnership model involving all the key participants,Body
"(i.e. government, libraries, donors, public and private sectors). All participants (i.e. beneficiaries) are",Body
expected to make financial contributions to the ODL. It is important in achieving the full impact of the,Body
"ODL on Ontario’s economy, society and learning support that all library sectors are participants",Body
"(university, colleges, public libraries and schools).",Body
"The proposed funding model requires a continuing government investment, but also recognizes that as",Body
the ODL matures a growing share of ODL funding will come from libraries and non-governmental,Body
sources. During the 3-year implementation phase (2004 – 2006) libraries will realign their budgets to,Body
enable ongoing funding contributions to ODL. During the same period ODL must build the proposed,Body
endowment and secure public and private sector gifts and/or in-kind contributions. The following chart,Body
outlines the model. This model is based on these assumptions:,Body
1. that ODL expenditures will increase by 50% over a 10 year period,Body
2. that government funding will decrease from 70% to 45% during that 10 year period,Body
"3. that library contributions, endowment and gifts/in-kind funding will increase from 30% to 55%",Body
during the same period,Body

"While the private sector will be invited to participate in the ODL through the endowment, gifts and in-",Body
"kind contributions, the ODL will also explore compatible commercial services which leverage the reach",Body
of the ODL and help to offset operating costs.,Body
A $50M budget leverages the consortium buying power of the province’s libraries to secure the best,Body
"prices for information resources, the widest accessibility and the most favourable contracts. A budget of",Body
this nature will ensure a core digital collection of sufficient scope and coverage to address a substantial,Body
amount of the wide and diverse information and learning needs of the citizens of Ontario (an overview,Body
of the nature of the ODL digital collection is appended). The proposed ODL expenditures in 2006,Body
represent an investment of $5.00 per citizen.,Body
It is important to recognize that every new dollar per citizen invested in the Ontario Digital Library has a,Body
double benefit: it supports a province-wide library of high quality information resources and it,Body
strengthens every local library in Ontario by allowing them to reinvest existing dollars in new resources,Body
that enhance local services. This multiplier means that for every dollar invested in ODL the return,Body
on investment is worth $2 of value for Ontario.,Body
